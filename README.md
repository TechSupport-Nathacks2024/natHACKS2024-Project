## Project Description
DriveSafe is an innovative safety app designed to monitor driver alertness and ensure safe driving, using Muse S to measure brain activity, tracking fatigue and concentration to ensure driver alertness. Our app continuously monitors driver alertness by integrating neurotechnology and AI, utilizing EEG data from the Muse S device and real-time facial analysis through a camera feed. We built the app with a React frontend and a Flask backend to efficiently process live data. The Muse S device captures EEG signals, which we filter to assess concentration and fatigue levels. Simultaneously, OpenCV analyzes facial landmarks to detect signs of drowsiness like eye closure and yawning. When decreased alertness is detected, the system provides real-time voice alerts to help drivers refocus. To offer a comprehensive safety approach, we integrated a weather API to account for external conditions that might impact driver alertness.
